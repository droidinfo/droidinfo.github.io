<p>
  The fact that Android source is open source is one of its key strengths. The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive free software license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software for any purpose, including commercial purposes. This makes Android source a valuable resource for developers who want to create custom versions of Android or develop new applications for the platform.
</p>
<p>
  There are many benefits to using open source software. First, it is free to use and modify, which can save developers time and money. Second, open source software is typically more secure than closed source software, as it is constantly being reviewed and updated by a community of developers. Third, open source software is more customizable than closed source software, as developers can modify it to meet their specific needs.
</p>
<p>
  The open source nature of Android source has been a major factor in its success. It has allowed developers to create a wide range of custom Android distributions, such as LineageOS and /e/OS. It has also allowed developers to create a vast ecosystem of Android applications, many of which are free and open source.

It provides developers with the freedom to create custom versions of Android and develop new applications, which has led to a wide range of innovative and cutting-edge Android devices and applications.
</p>
<h3>Customizable</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Customizable, Android Apps" title="Customizable, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Customizable%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The customizability of Android source is one of its key strengths. It allows developers to create custom versions of Android that are tailored to their specific needs. This can be done by modifying the source code to add or remove features, change the user interface, or optimize the performance of the operating system.
</p>
<p>
  There are many benefits to creating a custom version of Android. First, it allows developers to create a version of the operating system that is specifically designed for their target audience. For example, a developer could create a custom version of Android for a particular industry, such as healthcare or education. Second, it allows developers to create a version of the operating system that is optimized for a particular device. For example, a developer could create a custom version of Android for a low-power device or a device with a specific form factor.
</p>
<p>
  There are many examples of custom versions of Android that have been created by developers. For example, LineageOS is a popular custom ROM that is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). LineageOS is designed to be a lean and fast version of Android that is free from bloatware. /e/OS is another popular custom ROM that is focused on privacy and security. /e/OS removes all of the Google apps and services from Android and replaces them with open source alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  The customizability of Android source is a key reason why it is such a popular platform for developers. It allows developers to create custom versions of Android that are tailored to their specific needs. This has led to a wide range of innovative and cutting-edge Android devices and applications.
