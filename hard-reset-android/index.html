    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  When performing a hard reset on your Android device, it's crucial to understand the potential data loss that occurs. This means that all user data, including apps, files, and settings, will be permanently erased from the device.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Component: User Data</strong><br />
    <p>
      User data encompasses all the information and content that you have stored on your device, such as photos, videos, music, documents, contacts, messages, and app data. A hard reset will wipe out all of this data, leaving your device with a clean slate.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Component: Apps</strong><br />
    <p>
      All the applications that you have installed on your device, including both pre-installed and downloaded apps, will be removed during a hard reset. This means that you will need to reinstall all of your apps after the reset is complete.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Component: Files</strong><br />
    <p>
      Any files that you have stored on your device's internal storage, such as photos, videos, music, and documents, will be deleted during a hard reset. External storage, such as an SD card, will not be affected unless you specifically choose to format it as well.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Component: Settings</strong><br />
    <p>
      All of the settings that you have customized on your device, including Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth connections, and display preferences, will be reset to their default values. This means that you will need to reconfigure your settings after the hard reset is complete.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is important to note that a hard reset is a permanent action. Once you have performed a hard reset, there is no way to recover the data that was erased. Therefore, it is crucial to back up your data before performing a hard reset, especially if you have important files or settings that you do not want to lose.
</p>
