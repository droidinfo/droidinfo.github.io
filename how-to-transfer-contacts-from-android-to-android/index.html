  Transferring contacts via an SD card offers an additional method for moving contacts between Android devices. This approach involves backing up the contacts to an SD card on one device and then manually copying them to the SD card on the other device.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Convenience:</strong> SD cards are widely available and provide a portable storage option for transferring contacts. They can be easily inserted and removed from both Android devices, allowing for a convenient transfer process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flexibility:</strong> SD cards come in various storage capacities, enabling users to transfer a large number of contacts, even if they exceed the internal storage space of the devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> SD cards can be used to transfer contacts between Android devices from different manufacturers, making it a versatile option for various scenarios.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manual process:</strong> While SD cards offer flexibility, the transfer process requires manual copying of the contacts from one device to another. This can be time-consuming, especially for large contact lists.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In summary, transferring contacts via an SD card is a feasible method that offers convenience, flexibility, and cross-platform compatibility. However, it requires manual copying, which may not be the most efficient approach for large contact lists or frequent transfers.
