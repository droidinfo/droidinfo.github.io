    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Convenience, Android Apps" title="Convenience, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Convenience%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  One of the biggest benefits of Wi-Fi calling on Android is its convenience. With Wi-Fi calling, you can make and receive calls from anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection, even if you don't have a cellular signal. This is especially useful in areas with poor cellular coverage, such as rural areas or inside buildings. Wi-Fi calling can also be useful when you're traveling internationally, as it can help you avoid expensive roaming charges.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you're in a rural area with poor cellular coverage, you can still make and receive calls using Wi-Fi calling as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection. This can be a lifesaver if you need to make an emergency call or if you're trying to stay connected with family and friends.
</p>
<p>
  Wi-Fi calling is a valuable feature for anyone who wants to stay connected, even in areas with poor cellular coverage. It's easy to set up and use, and it can save you money on your phone bill.

<h3>Improved call quality</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Improved Call Quality, Android Apps" title="Improved Call Quality, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Improved%20call%20quality%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Wi-Fi calling can provide better call quality than cellular calling for several reasons. First, Wi-Fi networks typically have a stronger and more stable signal than cellular networks. This is especially true in areas with poor cellular coverage, such as rural areas or inside buildings. Second, Wi-Fi calling uses a different technology than cellular calling, which can result in clearer and more reliable calls.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you're in a rural area with poor cellular coverage, you may experience dropped calls or poor call quality when using cellular calling. However, if you switch to Wi-Fi calling, you may be able to make and receive calls with better clarity and reliability.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Wi-Fi calling is a valuable feature that can improve your call quality, especially in areas with poor cellular coverage.
