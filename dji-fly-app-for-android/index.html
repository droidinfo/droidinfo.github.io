<h3>Safety Features</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Safety Features, Android Apps" title="Safety Features, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Safety%20Features%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The DJI Fly App for Android includes a range of safety features that are designed to protect drone pilots and their aircraft. These features include geofencing and obstacle avoidance, which work together to provide enhanced protection during flight.
</p>
<p>
  Geofencing is a virtual boundary that can be set around a specific area. When a drone enters a geofenced area, it will automatically return to its home point. This is useful for preventing drones from flying into restricted areas, such as airports or military bases.
</p>
<p>
  Obstacle avoidance is a system that uses sensors to detect obstacles in the drone's path. When an obstacle is detected, the drone will automatically avoid it by changing its flight path. This is useful for preventing collisions with trees, buildings, and other objects.
</p>
<p>
  Together, geofencing and obstacle avoidance provide enhanced protection for drone pilots and their aircraft. These features help to prevent accidents and ensure that drones are flown safely and responsibly.
