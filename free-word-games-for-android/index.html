    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The landscape of free word games for Android is shaped by the presence of in-app purchases, which can either be optional or mandatory. Understanding the implications of these two models is crucial for players seeking a transparent and enjoyable gaming experience.

Optional in-app purchases allow players to customize their experience and support the developers without feeling pressured to spend money.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mandatory In-App Purchases:</strong><br />
    Mandatory in-app purchases, on the other hand, require players to spend money to progress through the game or access essential features. These purchases can be frustrating for players who wish to enjoy the game without additional expenses. Mandatory in-app purchases can also disrupt the game's balance, as players who spend more money may gain an unfair advantage over those who do not.
  </li>
</ul>
