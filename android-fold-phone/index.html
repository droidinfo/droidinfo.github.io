<h3>Durable</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Durable, Android Apps" title="Durable, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Durable%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The durability of Android Fold phones is one of their main drawbacks. They are not as durable as traditional smartphones, making them more susceptible to damage. This is because they have a flexible display that is more likely to break than a traditional glass display. Additionally, the hinge that allows the phone to fold is also a potential point of failure.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fragile display:</strong> The flexible display on Android Fold phones is more fragile than the glass display on traditional smartphones. This means that it is more likely to crack or break if it is dropped or bumped.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Weak hinge:</strong> The hinge that allows Android Fold phones to fold is also a potential point of failure. If the hinge is damaged, the phone may not be able to fold or unfold properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Water resistance:</strong> Android Fold phones are not as water resistant as traditional smartphones. This means that they are more likely to be damaged if they are dropped in water or exposed to rain.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The reduced durability of Android Fold phones is a significant drawback. It is important to be aware of this before purchasing an Android Fold phone, and to take steps to protect the phone from damage.
</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
