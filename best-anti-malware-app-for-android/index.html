    <strong>Reputation of the Developer</strong><br />
    <p>
      The reputation of the developer can also affect the price of an anti malware app. Apps from well-known and reputable developers are typically more expensive than apps from unknown or less reputable developers.

  <li>
    <strong>Value for Money</strong><br />
    <p>
      When choosing an anti malware app, it is important to consider the value for money. The best anti malware app for android will offer a good balance of price, features, and protection.
