    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  When an app keeps stopping on your Android device, one of the first things you should try is clearing the cache and data for that app. The cache is a temporary storage area that stores frequently accessed data, while the data includes all of the app's settings and preferences. Clearing the cache and data can help to fix the "app keeps stopping" error by removing any corrupted or outdated files.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved performance:</strong> Clearing the cache and data can help to improve the performance of your Android device by freeing up space and removing any unnecessary files.

<p>
  Clearing the cache and data is a simple and effective way to fix the "app keeps stopping" error. It is a good second step to try after restarting your device.
</p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Deletes corrupted files:</strong> Uninstalling the app will delete all of its files from your device, including any corrupted or outdated files that may be causing the "app keeps stopping" error.

    <br/>
    </center>
