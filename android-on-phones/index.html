</p>
<p>
  In contrast, iPhones are only manufactured by Apple, and Apple's phones are generally more expensive than Android phones. The cheapest iPhone currently available is the iPhone SE, which costs $399. The most expensive iPhone currently available is the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which costs $1,099.
</p>
<p>
