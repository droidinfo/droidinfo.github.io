    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Applying Effects:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Effects offer creative possibilities to enhance the visual appeal of screen recordings. Users can apply filters, adjust colors, or add transitions to create a more engaging and visually appealing experience. This is especially beneficial for creating promotional videos, artistic content, or stylized tutorials.
