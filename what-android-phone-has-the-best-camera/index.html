  In the realm of smartphone photography, sensor size plays a pivotal role in determining the overall image quality captured by a device. Larger sensors, measured diagonally in inches or millimeters, have several advantages that contribute to the pursuit of "what Android phone has the best camera."
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, larger sensors can capture more light. This is because they have a greater surface area to collect photons, the fundamental particles of light. Increased light capture leads to brighter images, particularly in low-light conditions where smaller sensors struggle to gather sufficient light. Brighter images exhibit reduced noise and grain, resulting in cleaner and more visually appealing photographs.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, larger sensors enable better control over depth of field. Depth of field refers to the range of distance that appears sharp in an image. Larger sensors allow for shallower depth of field, which can effectively isolate the subject from the background, creating a visually pleasing bokeh effect. This technique is commonly used in portrait photography to draw attention to the subject while blurring the surroundings.
</p>
<p>
  Thirdly, larger sensors often accommodate larger pixels. Larger pixels are more sensitive to light and produce a stronger electrical signal, which translates into improved image quality. They are less prone to noise and produce images with better dynamic range, capturing a wider spectrum of tones and details from the brightest highlights to the deepest shadows.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, sensor size is a crucial factor to consider when evaluating "what Android phone has the best camera." Larger sensors capture more light, enabling brighter images with reduced noise, better control over depth of field, and improved sensitivity to light.
