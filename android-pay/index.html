<p>
  The security of Android Pay is one of its most important features. In an era of increasing cybercrime, people are understandably concerned about the safety of their financial information. Android Pay addresses these concerns by using tokenization to protect your payment information.
</p>
<p>
  Tokenization is a process that replaces your actual credit or debit card number with a unique token. This token is used to process your payments, but it cannot be used to identify you or your financial information. This makes it much more difficult for criminals to steal your money, even if they are able to access your phone.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to tokenization, Android Pay also uses other security measures to protect your information, such as encryption and fraud detection. This makes Android Pay one of the most secure mobile payment services available.
</p>
<p>
  The security of Android Pay is essential for its success. People need to be confident that their financial information is safe when they use Android Pay. The security measures that Android Pay has put in place give people that confidence.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Here are some examples of how the security of Android Pay has helped people:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 2017, a woman's phone was stolen. The thief tried to use her Android Pay account to make purchases, but they were unsuccessful because Android Pay's security measures prevented them from accessing her financial information.
  </li>
  <li>In 2018, a man lost his phone while on vacation. He was able to remotely disable his Android Pay account, preventing the thief from using it to make purchases.
