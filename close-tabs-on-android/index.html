<h3>Background tabs</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Background Tabs, Android Apps" title="Background Tabs, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Background%20tabs%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Background tabs are a feature of Android that allows users to keep tabs open in the background, even when they are not actively using them. This can be useful for quickly switching between tabs, but it can also lead to decreased performance and battery life. Closing background tabs can help to improve performance and save memory, especially on devices with limited resources.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced memory usage</strong>: When a tab is open in the background, it continues to use memory, even if it is not being actively used. Closing background tabs can free up memory, which can improve performance and make your device run more smoothly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved performance</strong>: When you have a lot of tabs open in the background, it can slow down your device. This is because the system has to constantly keep track of all of the open tabs, which can use up processing power and memory. Closing background tabs can help to improve performance, especially on devices with limited resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extended battery life</strong>: When you have a lot of tabs open in the background, it can drain your battery more quickly. This is because the system has to constantly keep track of all of the open tabs, which can use up power. Closing background tabs can help to extend battery life, especially on devices with limited battery capacity.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In conclusion, closing background tabs can help to improve performance, save memory, and extend battery life on Android devices. If you are experiencing slow performance or battery drain, closing background tabs is a good place to start.
</p>
<h3>Recent tabs</h3>

    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The ability to quickly reopen recently closed tabs is an essential component of the "close tabs on Android" functionality. When you close a tab, it is added to the "Recent tabs" list in the tab switcher. This allows you to easily reopen the tab if you accidentally closed it or if you need to access it again later.
</p>
<p>
  The "Recent tabs" feature is especially useful when you are browsing the web with multiple tabs open. It can be difficult to keep track of all of the tabs that you have open, and you may accidentally close a tab that you meant to keep open. The "Recent tabs" feature allows you to quickly reopen the tab without having to search through your browsing history.
</p>
<p>
  The "Recent tabs" feature is also useful for accessing tabs that you have closed in the past. For example, if you are doing research on a topic and you close a tab that contains a useful article, you can easily reopen the tab from the "Recent tabs" list. This can save you time and effort.
