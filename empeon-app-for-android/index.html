    <strong>Enhanced Decision-Making:</strong> AR empowers users to make more informed decisions about their designs by providing a realistic preview of how they will look in their actual space. This eliminates the guesswork and uncertainty often associated with traditional design methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Space Optimization:</strong> By visualizing designs in their own space, users can assess how furniture and other elements will fit and interact with the existing layout. This helps them optimize space utilization and create a more functional and cohesive design.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced Design Errors:</strong> AR technology helps minimize the risk of design errors by allowing users to identify potential issues or clashes before committing to a final design. This saves time, effort, and resources that would otherwise be spent on costly rework.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The practical applications of AR integration within the Empeon app for Android are extensive. For instance, users can:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virtually place furniture in their living room to determine the optimal arrangement and scale.
  </li>
  <li>Visualize how a new kitchen layout will impact the flow and functionality of the space.
