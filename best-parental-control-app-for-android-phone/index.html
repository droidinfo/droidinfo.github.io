    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Track Your Child&#039;s Location, Android Apps" title="Track Your Child&#039;s Location, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Track%20your%20child%27s%20location%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />

</p>
<ul>

  Geofencing is a feature offered by many of the best parental control apps for Android phones. It allows parents to create virtual boundaries around specific locations, such as their home, school, or a friend's house.

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Geofencing can give parents peace of mind knowing that they will be notified if their child leaves a certain area. This can be especially helpful for parents of young children or children with special needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Safety:</strong> Geofencing can also be used to keep children safe. For example, parents can create a geofence around their home and set it to alert them if their child leaves the house without permission. This can help to prevent children from wandering off or getting lost.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Convenience:</strong> Geofencing can also be used for convenience. For example, parents can create a geofence around their child's school and set it to send them a reminder to pick up their child when school is over.
