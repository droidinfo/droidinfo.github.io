<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Protocol Overview:</strong><br />
    <p>
      The APN roaming protocol determines the set of rules and formats used for data transmission between the Android device and the visited network. IPv4 and IPv6 represent the two primary versions of the Internet Protocol (IP), each possessing distinct characteristics and capabilities.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>IPv4:</strong><br />
    <p>
      IPv4, the foundation of the internet, assigns each device a unique 32-bit IP address. Despite its widespread adoption, IPv4's address space is gradually being exhausted due to the exponential growth of internet-connected devices.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>IPv6:</strong><br />

Understanding the significance of this setting is crucial for optimizing network performance and ensuring a reliable mobile experience.
</p>
<p>
  Verizon's APN settings support three primary bearer technologies:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>LTE (Long-Term Evolution):</strong> LTE is a high-speed wireless communication technology that provides significantly faster data rates and lower latency compared to previous generations. It is the preferred bearer technology for data-intensive applications such as streaming, gaming, and video conferencing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access):</strong> CDMA is a legacy technology that was widely used in 2G and 3G networks. It is still employed in certain areas where LTE coverage is limited or unavailable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized):</strong> EvDO is an enhanced version of CDMA that offers improved data speeds and is commonly used in areas with limited LTE coverage.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The device will automatically select the most appropriate bearer technology based on network availability and signal strength. However, users may encounter situations where manually specifying the bearer technology is necessary to resolve connectivity issues or optimize performance.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if a user is experiencing slow data speeds in an area with strong LTE coverage, manually setting the bearer to "LTE only" may improve performance. Conversely, in areas with weak LTE signals, setting the bearer to "CDMA" or "EvDO" may provide a more stable connection.
</p>
