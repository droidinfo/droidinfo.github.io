  One common monetization strategy is through in-app purchases. This involves offering additional features, content, or services within your app that users can purchase to enhance their experience.

</p>
<p>
  Subscription-based monetization is another option, where users pay a recurring fee to access your app or its premium features. This model can provide a steady stream of revenue and is often used by apps that offer ongoing value or exclusive content. For example, a news app may offer a subscription for premium content or ad-free access.
