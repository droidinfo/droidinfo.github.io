  Performing a factory reset on your Android phone will erase all data on your device, including apps, contacts, and messages. This is because a factory reset restores your phone to its original factory settings, wiping away any data that has been added since you first purchased the phone.
</p>
<ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loss of apps and settings:</strong> All of the apps that you have installed on your phone will be uninstalled, and all of your settings will be reset to their default values. This means that you will need toconfigure your phone from scratch.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security implications:</strong> A factory reset can also be used to securely wipe your phone's data before selling or recycling it. This is because a factory reset will overwrite all of the data on your phone with random data, making it impossible to recover.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is important to understand the potential consequences of a factory reset before you proceed. If you are not comfortable performing a factory reset yourself, you can take your phone to a qualified repair technician.
