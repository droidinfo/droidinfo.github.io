</p>
<p>
  The design process involves creating the app's user interface (UI), which includes elements such as screens, buttons, menus, and icons. Designers must consider various factors, including color schemes, typography, and layout, to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, the popular e-commerce app Amazon has a clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to find and purchase products. The app's intuitive design contributes to its high user ratings and overall success.
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">

    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Deployment, the process of publishing an app on the Google Play Store, is a crucial step in the Android app development lifecycle. It involves preparing the app for distribution, uploading it to the store, and making it available to users.
</p>
<p>
  Without deployment, an app would remain inaccessible to users, limiting its reach and potential impact. By publishing the app on the Google Play Store, developers can distribute their app to a vast audience, gain visibility, and generate revenue through downloads and in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, the popular game Pokmon GO was downloaded over 1 billion times within its first year of release. This massive success can be attributed in part to its effective deployment strategy, which made the game widely available to users around the world.
