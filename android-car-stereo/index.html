</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Convenience:</strong> Built-in GPS eliminates the need to connect your phone to your car stereo in order to use navigation apps. This can be a major convenience, especially if you frequently use navigation apps while driving.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Built-in GPS receivers are often more accurate than the GPS receivers in smartphones. This is because car stereos are typically mounted in a more optimal location for GPS reception.

<h3>Bluetooth connectivity</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Bluetooth Connectivity, Android Apps" title="Bluetooth Connectivity, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Bluetooth%20connectivity%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Bluetooth connectivity is an essential feature of any modern car stereo, and Android car stereos are no exception. Bluetooth connectivity allows you to connect your smartphone to your car stereo wirelessly, so you can make and receive calls hands-free and stream music from your phone.
</p>
<p>
  There are many benefits to using Bluetooth connectivity in your car. First, it can help to improve safety while driving. When you're using Bluetooth to make calls, you don't have to take your hands off the wheel to dial a number or answer a call. This can help to reduce the risk of accidents.
</p>
<p>
  Second, Bluetooth connectivity can help to improve the convenience of driving. When you're using Bluetooth to stream music, you don't have to worry about plugging your phone into your car stereo. You can simply start playing music on your phone and it will automatically start playing through your car stereo.
</p>
<p>
  Third, Bluetooth connectivity can help to improve the sound quality of your music. When you're using Bluetooth to stream music, the audio signal is sent wirelessly from your phone to your car stereo. This can result in a higher quality sound than if you were to connect your phone to your car stereo using a wired connection.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, Bluetooth connectivity is a valuable feature that can improve the safety, convenience, and sound quality of your driving experience. If you're looking for a new car stereo, be sure to choose one that has built-in Bluetooth connectivity.

  <li>
    <strong>Widgets:</strong> Widgets are small apps that can be placed on the stereo's home screen. Widgets can provide quick access to information and functionality, such as the weather forecast, music player, or navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Customizable settings:</strong> In addition to themes and widgets, many Android car stereos also allow users to customize a variety of other settings, such as the brightness, contrast, and volume.
