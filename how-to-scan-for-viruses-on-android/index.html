  When it comes to protecting your Android device from viruses, there are a number of important security features to consider. One of these features is sandboxing. Sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates suspicious files in a safe environment to prevent them from infecting your device. This is important because it allows you to scan files for viruses without putting your device at risk.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how sandboxing works: when you download a file from the internet or open an email attachment, your antivirus software will scan the file for viruses. If the antivirus software detects suspicious activity, it will move the file to a sandbox. The sandbox is a separate, isolated environment on your device where the file can be further analyzed without being able to infect your device.
