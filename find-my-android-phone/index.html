They could also use this information to steal your identity or commit other crimes.
</p>
<p>
  Second, data erasure can help to protect your financial information. If your phone contains sensitive financial information, such as your credit card numbers or bank account information, a thief could use this information to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, data erasure can help to protect your personal and private information. If your phone contains sensitive personal information, such as your medical records or legal documents, a thief could use this information to blackmail you or to embarrass you.

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once you have erased your data, it will be permanently deleted from your phone.
</p>
