    </center>
<p>
  Open source Android apps are highly customizable, which is one of their key advantages over proprietary apps. This means that you can modify the app to meet your specific needs and preferences. For example, you can change the app's appearance, add new features, or remove features that you don't use.
</p>
<p>
  There are many ways to customize open source Android apps. One way is to use the app's built-in customization options. Many open source apps allow you to change the app's theme, font, and other visual elements. You can also often add new features to the app by installing plugins or extensions.

<h3>Cross-platform</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Cross-platform, Android Apps" title="Cross-platform, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Cross-platform%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The cross-platform nature of open source Android apps is a significant advantage over proprietary apps. It means that you can use the same app on multiple devices, regardless of the operating system. This can be very convenient if you have multiple devices or if you switch devices frequently.
</p>
<p>
  There are several reasons why open source Android apps are more likely to be cross-platform than proprietary apps. First, open source apps are not tied to any specific platform. This means that developers can port the app to other platforms relatively easily.
</p>
