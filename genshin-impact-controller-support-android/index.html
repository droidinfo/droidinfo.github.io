If the controller does not work, you can try using a different controller or using a third-party app to map the controller's buttons to the on-screen controls.

Controllers provide a more precise and responsive way to control movement and aim, giving players a competitive advantage in combat.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Improved precision</b> is also important in <i>Genshin Impact</i>, as it allows players to perform more precise actions, such as picking up items or activating switches.

This can be especially important for players who plan on playing <i>Genshin Impact</i> for long periods of time.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, using a controller with <i>Genshin Impact</i> on Android provides a number of advantages over using touch controls. These advantages include improved accuracy, precision, and comfort.

  When considering genshin impact controller support android, it's important to be aware of the potential disadvantages of using a controller. Controllers can be more expensive than touch controls, and they can also be more difficult to use in some situations.
</p>
<p>
  One of the main disadvantages of controllers is that they can be more expensive than touch controls. This is especially true for high-quality controllers that are designed for gaming. For example, the official PlayStation 5 DualSense controller costs around $70, while a good quality third-party controller can cost around $30. In comparison, touch controls are free to use, as they are built into the Android device.
</p>
<p>
  Another disadvantage of controllers is that they can be more difficult to use in some situations. For example, controllers can be difficult to use when playing games that require precise movements, such as platformers or racing games. Controllers can also be difficult to use when playing games that require a lot of button presses, such as fighting games or action RPGs.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the disadvantages of controllers are relatively minor. However, it is important to be aware of these disadvantages before purchasing a controller for genshin impact controller support android.

  While controllers offer a number of advantages over touch controls, some players may prefer to use a keyboard and mouse. This is especially true for players who are used to playing PC games, as a keyboard and mouse can provide a more familiar and comfortable gaming experience.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of benefits to using a keyboard and mouse with <em>Genshin Impact</em> on Android. First, a keyboard and mouse provide more precise control over movement and aiming. This can be especially helpful in combat, where precise aim is essential for hitting targets. Second, a keyboard and mouse allow players to use more key binds, which can give them a competitive advantage in combat. Third, a keyboard and mouse can be more comfortable to use for extended periods of time, as they allow players to keep their hands and wrists in a more natural position.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there are also some disadvantages to using a keyboard and mouse with <em>Genshin Impact</em> on Android. First, a keyboard and mouse can be more expensive than a controller. Second, a keyboard and mouse can be more difficult to set up and configure than a controller. Third, a keyboard and mouse can be more difficult to use when playing on the go, as they require a flat surface to use.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the decision of whether to use a controller or a keyboard and mouse with <em>Genshin Impact</em> on Android is a personal preference. If you are looking for the most precise and comfortable gaming experience, then a keyboard and mouse is the best option.
