  Unwanted calls and messages can be a nuisance, but fortunately, there are simple and effective steps you can take to block them on your Android device. Here are some tips to help you get started:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Identify Unwanted Communications</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The first step to blocking unwanted calls and messages is to identify them. Look for unknown or suspicious phone numbers, messages from unfamiliar senders, or communications that contain spam, phishing attempts, or malware.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Utilize Built-in Blocking Features</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Android devices have built-in features that allow you to block unwanted calls and messages. Access the Settings menu or use the Phone or Messages app to block specific numbers, contacts, keywords, or even entire apps.

  Scammers and spammers are constantly finding new ways to bypass blocking methods. Stay vigilant and be aware of the latest scams and spam techniques. Update your blocking rules and apps regularly to maintain effective protection.
