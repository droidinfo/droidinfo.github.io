<p>
  Maintenance is a critical but often overlooked aspect of building an Android app. Once your app is deployed to the Google Play Store, it is important to keep it up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. This ensures that your app remains functional, secure, and competitive in the ever-changing mobile landscape.
</p>
<p>
  There are many reasons why maintenance is important for Android apps. First, the Android operating system is constantly being updated with new features and security patches. If your app is not updated to the latest version of the operating system, it may not be able to take advantage of new features or it may be vulnerable to security exploits.
</p>
<p>
  Second, user expectations are constantly changing. Users expect apps to be regularly updated with new features and improvements. If your app is not updated regularly, users may become frustrated and switch to a competing app.
</p>
<p>
  Third, maintenance can help you to avoid negative reviews. Users are more likely to leave negative reviews for apps that are not up-to-date or that have security vulnerabilities. By keeping your app up-to-date, you can reduce the risk of negative reviews and improve your app's overall rating.
</p>
<p>
  There are many different ways to maintain an Android app. You can update the app yourself using the Android Studio development environment, or you can hire a developer to maintain the app for you. No matter how you choose to maintain your app, it is important to make sure that you have a plan in place to keep it up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Maintenance and Building an Android App: A Real-Life Example</strong><br />
