  When examining "do AirPods work on Android," it is essential to consider the customization limitations that Android users face compared to iOS users. AirPods offer a range of customizable gestures and settings on iOS devices, such as double-tapping to play or pause audio, invoking Siri, or changing tracks. However, these customization options are limited on Android devices.
</p>
<p>
  The restricted customization on Android stems from the deeper integration between AirPods and Apple's ecosystem. AirPods leverage Apple's W1 or H1 chip to enable seamless pairing and advanced features on iOS devices.
