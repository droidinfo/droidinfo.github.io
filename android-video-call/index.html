<h3>Security</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Security, Android Apps" title="Security, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Security%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Security is a major concern for many people who use video calling apps. After all, you're sharing your personal conversations and images with the other person on the call. That's why it's important to use a video calling app that has strong security features, such as end-to-end encryption.
</p>
<p>
  End-to-end encryption is a security measure that ensures that only the people on the call can see or hear the conversation. This is because the data is encrypted before it leaves your device and decrypted when it reaches the other person's device. This makes it impossible for anyone else to intercept and eavesdrop on your conversation, even if they have access to your device or the other person's device.
</p>
<p>
  Android video calls use end-to-end encryption to protect your privacy. This means that your conversations are secure and confidential. You can be confident that no one else can listen in on your calls.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the benefits of using Android video calls with end-to-end encryption:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your conversations are private and confidential.
  </li>
  <li>No one can listen in on your calls, even if they have access to your device or the other person's device.
  </li>
  <li>You can be confident that your conversations are secure.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you're looking for a secure and private way to make video calls, then Android video calls are a great option. With end-to-end encryption, you can be confident that your conversations are safe from eavesdropping.
