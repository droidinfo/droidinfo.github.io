Private calling features implement robust measures to ensure that the content of calls remains strictly confidential, shielded from unauthorized access or eavesdropping.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encryption:</strong> End-to-end encryption, a cornerstone of private calling, encrypts the content of calls, rendering them unintelligible to anyone except the intended recipient. This ensures that even if intercepted, the conversation remains private and secure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authentication:</strong> Strong authentication mechanisms verify the identities of callers and recipients, preventing unauthorized access to private calls. This prevents malicious actors from spoofing identities and eavesdropping on private conversations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secure Signaling:</strong> The signaling channels used to establish and manage private calls are protected using secure protocols, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This ensures that call metadata, such as caller ID and call duration, remains confidential.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Call Tampering Protection:</strong> Private calling protocols employ measures to protect calls from tampering or alteration during transmission. This ensures that the integrity of the conversation is maintained, and the content remains unaltered.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The confidentiality provided by private calling on Android empowers users to engage in sensitive conversations without fear of their privacy being compromised. This is particularly valuable for individuals dealing with confidential information, such as journalists, whistleblowers, or those in high-risk situations.
