  When choosing the best emulator nds android, it is important to consider whether the emulator is free or paid.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Support</strong><br />
    Paid emulators often come with better support than free emulators. This means that if you have any problems with the emulator, you can usually get help from the developer. Free emulators may not have any support, or the support may be limited.
