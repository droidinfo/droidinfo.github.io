</h2>
<p>
  App groups are a powerful tool that can help you organize your apps and share data between them. Here are seven key aspects of app groups to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Shared data:</strong> App groups allow you to share data between apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shared preferences:</strong> App groups also allow you to share preferences between apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shared files:</strong> App groups can share files between apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-launching:</strong> App groups can launch other apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Single sign-on:</strong> App groups can share authentication tokens between apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>App linking:</strong> App groups can create deep links that can be used to launch specific activities in other apps in the same group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>App indexing:</strong> App groups can share app indexing data between apps in the same group.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  App groups can be a valuable tool for developers who want to create a more seamless and integrated experience for their users. For example, a developer could create an app group for a suite of productivity apps that share data and preferences. This would allow users to easily switch between apps and pick up where they left off, without having to worry about losing data or re-entering their preferences.
</p>
<h3>Shared data</h3>

<h3>Shared files</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Shared Files, Android Apps" title="Shared Files, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Shared%20files%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  This feature of app groups is particularly useful for sharing large files or files that need to be accessed by multiple apps. For example, you could create an app group for a suite of productivity apps that share data and files such as images, videos and documents. This would allow users to easily access the same files from any of the apps in the group, without having to worry about manually transferring the files between apps.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 1: Sharing media files</strong><br />
    <p>
      One common use case for sharing files between apps in the same group is sharing media files, such as images and videos. This can be useful for creating a cohesive experience across multiple apps, such as a photo gallery app and a social media app. By sharing the same files between the apps, users can easily access and share their photos and videos from either app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Sharing documents</strong><br />
    Another common use case for sharing files between apps in the same group is sharing documents. This can be useful for creating a seamless workflow between multiple apps, such as a productivity suite or a project management app. By sharing the same documents between the apps, users can easily access and edit their documents from any of the apps in the group.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Sharing databases</strong><br />
    In some cases, it may be necessary to share a database between multiple apps in the same group. This can be useful for creating a consistent data experience across multiple apps, such as a customer relationship management (CRM) app and a sales app. By sharing the same database between the apps, users can access and update their data from any of the apps in the group.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the ability to share files between apps in the same group is a powerful feature that can be used to create a more seamless and integrated experience for users.
</p>
<h3>Cross-launching</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Cross-launching, Android Apps" title="Cross-launching, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Cross-launching%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Cross-launching is a powerful feature that allows app groups to launch other apps in the same group. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as opening a specific activity in another app, or launching a new app to handle a specific task.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Launching specific activities</strong><br />
    <p>
      One common use case for cross-launching is to launch a specific activity in another app. For example, you could create an app group for a suite of productivity apps, and use cross-launching to open a specific document in the document editor app from the file manager app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Launching new apps</strong><br />
    <p>
      Another common use case for cross-launching is to launch a new app to handle a specific task. For example, you could create an app group for a suite of social media apps, and use cross-launching to open a new instance of the messaging app from the main social media app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Creating a seamless experience</strong><br />
    <p>
      Cross-launching can be used to create a more seamless experience for users. For example, you could create an app group for a suite of travel apps, and use cross-launching to open the hotel booking app from the flight booking app.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, cross-launching is a powerful feature that can be used to create a more seamless and integrated experience for users.
</p>
<h3>Single sign-on</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Single Sign-on, Android Apps" title="Single Sign-on, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Single%20sign-on%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Single sign-on (SSO) is a feature that allows users to log in to multiple apps using the same credentials. This can be a major convenience for users, as they do not have to remember multiple usernames and passwords. SSO can also improve security, as it reduces the risk of users reusing the same password across multiple apps.
</p>
<p>
  App groups can take advantage of SSO to share authentication tokens between apps in the same group. This means that users only need to log in to one app in the group, and they will be automatically logged in to all of the other apps in the group. This can create a seamless and convenient experience for users.
</p>
<p>
  For example, imagine a user who has installed a suite of productivity apps from the same developer. Each app in the suite requires the user to log in with a username and password. If the apps are part of an app group, the user only needs to log in to one of the apps. Once they are logged in, they will be automatically logged in to all of the other apps in the group. This can save the user a lot of time and hassle.
</p>
<h3>Benefits of using SSO with app groups</h3>

</table>
<p>
  SSO is a valuable feature that can improve the user experience and security of app groups. Developers should consider using SSO in their app groups to provide a better experience for their users.
</p>
<h3>App linking</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="App Linking, Android Apps" title="App Linking, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=App%20linking%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  App linking is a powerful feature that allows app groups to create deep links that can be used to launch specific activities in other apps in the same group. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as opening a specific document in another app, or launching a new app to handle a specific task.
</p>
<p>
  For example, imagine a user who has installed a suite of productivity apps from the same developer. Each app in the suite has its own specific purpose, such as creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. If the apps are part of an app group, the user can create a deep link that will open a specific document in the document editor app from the file manager app. This can save the user a lot of time and hassle, as they do not have to manually find the document and open it in the document editor app.
</p>
<p>
  App linking can also be used to launch new apps to handle specific tasks. For example, imagine a user who is using a social media app and wants to share a photo with a friend. If the social media app and the messaging app are part of the same app group, the user can create a deep link that will open a new instance of the messaging app with the photo already attached. This can save the user a lot of time and hassle, as they do not have to manually find the messaging app and attach the photo.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, app linking is a powerful feature that can be used to create a more seamless and integrated experience for users. Developers should consider using app linking in their app groups to provide a better experience for their users.

  App indexing is a feature that allows apps to make their content searchable within Google Search. This can be useful for users who are looking for specific information or functionality within an app. For example, a user could search for "create a new document" and Google Search would show results that include apps that can create new documents.
</p>
<p>
  App groups can share app indexing data between apps in the same group. This means that if a user searches for a specific piece of content within one app in the group, the results will also include relevant content from other apps in the group. This can be useful for users who are looking for related content across multiple apps.
</p>
<p>
  For example, imagine a user who has installed a suite of productivity apps from the same developer. Each app in the suite has its own specific purpose, such as creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. If the apps are part of an app group, the user can search for a specific piece of content within one of the apps, and the results will also include relevant content from the other apps in the group. This can save the user a lot of time and hassle, as they do not have to manually search for the content in each individual app.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, app indexing is a powerful feature that can help users find the content they are looking for more quickly and easily. App groups can take advantage of app indexing to share content between apps in the same group, which can create a more seamless and integrated experience for users.
