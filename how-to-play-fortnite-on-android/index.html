Rewards often include exclusive cosmetic items, giving players a sense of distinction.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Experience Points</strong><br />
    <p>
      Experience points (XP) contribute to a player's level and Battle Pass progress. Rewards often include substantial XP, enabling players to level up faster, unlock new tiers in the Battle Pass, and earn additional rewards.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Event-Exclusive Rewards</strong><br />
    <p>
      Fortnite regularly hosts special events with unique rewards. These rewards can include exclusive cosmetic items, rare weapons, or even new game modes. Participating in events and completing associated challenges provides players with the opportunity to acquire these limited-time rewards.
