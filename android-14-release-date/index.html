  The new Privacy Sandbox is a set of technologies that gives users more control over their data and privacy. For example, users will be able to choose which apps can access their location data, and they will be able to see how apps are using their data. The redesigned Clock app makes it easier to see the time in different time zones, and it includes a new bedtime mode that helps users get a better night's sleep. Support for Bluetooth LE Audio provides higher quality audio than previous Bluetooth codecs, and it also supports new features such as multi-stream audio and low-latency audio.
</p>
<p>
  These are just a few of the many new features and improvements that are coming to Android 14. These features are designed to make Android devices more secure, user-friendly, and efficient. They are also a testament to Google's commitment to innovation and to providing users with the best possible experience.
