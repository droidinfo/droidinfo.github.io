  The method for deleting apps varies depending on whether the app is pre-installed or downloaded is a critical component of understanding how to delete any app on Android. Pre-installed apps are apps that come with the device when you purchase it, while downloaded apps are apps that you install from the Google Play Store or other sources.
</p>
<p>
  Pre-installed apps cannot be deleted using the same method as downloaded apps. This is because pre-installed apps are part of the Android operating system, and deleting them could cause your device to malfunction. Downloaded apps, on the other hand, can be deleted easily from the Settings menu or the app drawer.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding the difference between pre-installed and downloaded apps is important for deleting apps on Android. If you try to delete a pre-installed app using the same method as a downloaded app, you will not be successful.

  The difficulty in deleting pre-installed apps is a critical component of understanding how to delete any app on Android. Pre-installed apps are apps that come with the device when you purchase it, and they are often deeply integrated into the Android operating system. Deleting these apps can cause your device to malfunction, which is why it is often difficult or impossible to do so.
</p>
<p>
  Downloaded apps, on the other hand, are apps that you install from the Google Play Store or other sources. These apps are not as deeply integrated into the Android operating system, so they can be deleted easily from the Settings menu or the app drawer.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding the difference in difficulty between deleting pre-installed and downloaded apps is important for deleting apps on Android. If you try to delete a pre-installed app using the same method as a downloaded app, you will not be successful.

  Deleting apps can free up space on your Android device and improve performance. This is because apps take up space on your device's storage, and they can also run in the background, consuming resources and slowing down your device. By deleting apps that you no longer use, you can free up space and improve the performance of your device.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you have a lot of games installed on your device, deleting some of them can free up a significant amount of space. This can be especially helpful if you are running low on storage space. Deleting apps can also improve the performance of your device by freeing up RAM and CPU resources. This can make your device run faster and more smoothly.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to note that deleting apps will not always free up a significant amount of space or improve the performance of your device. However, if you have a lot of apps installed on your device, deleting some of them can be a good way to free up space and improve performance.

<h3>Pre-installed apps</h3>

<p>
  Understanding the difference between pre-installed apps and downloaded apps is crucial for successfully deleting any app on Android. Pre-installed apps are apps that come with the device when you purchase it, while downloaded apps are apps that you install from the Google Play Store or other sources. Some pre-installed apps cannot be deleted because they are essential for the functioning of the Android operating system. Other pre-installed apps can be disabled or uninstalled, but this process can vary depending on the device.
</p>
<p>
  For example, on some devices, you can disable pre-installed apps by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; All apps. Then, tap on the app you want to disable and select the "Disable" button. On other devices, you may need to use a third-party app manager to disable or uninstall pre-installed apps.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to note that disabling or uninstalling pre-installed apps can have unintended consequences. For example, disabling or uninstalling a pre-installed app that is responsible for a specific function, such as making phone calls or sending text messages, could cause your device to malfunction. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences before disabling or uninstalling any pre-installed apps.
</p>
<p>
  The table below summarizes the key differences between pre-installed apps and downloaded apps:
