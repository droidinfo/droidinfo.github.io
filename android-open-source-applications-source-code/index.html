<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Flexibility, Android Apps" title="Flexibility, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Flexibility%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The flexibility of open source code is a key factor in its widespread adoption for Android application development. Open source code allows developers to create apps that can be deployed across a wide range of devices and platforms, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and even TVs.
</p>
<p>
  This flexibility is particularly important in the Android ecosystem, which is known for its fragmentation. With a vast array of device manufacturers and Android versions in the market, developers need to ensure that their apps are compatible with as many devices as possible. Open source code provides them with the tools and freedom to achieve this compatibility.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the flexibility of open source code allows developers to create apps that can be easily ported to other platforms. For example, an app developed for Android using open source code can be easily ported to iOS or Windows with minimal effort.
</p>
<p>
  The flexibility of open source code not only benefits developers but also end-users. By enabling developers to create apps that can be used on a variety of devices and platforms, open source code contributes to a more diverse and vibrant Android app ecosystem.
