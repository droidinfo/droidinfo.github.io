      Downloading apps from unverified sources, such as third-party app stores or untrustworthy websites, increases the risk of malware infection. These sources may host malicious apps that are not subject to the same security checks as apps from official app stores.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Malware can also be spread through phishing emails or text messages that contain links to malicious websites or attachments. These websites or attachments may appear legitimate but are designed to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware.
