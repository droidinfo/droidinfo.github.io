  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The ability to customize these settings empowers users to optimize their screen recordings for different purposes. For example, a gamer may prioritize high resolution and frame rate for capturing visually stunning gameplay, while a teacher may opt for lower resolution and frame rate to create a more manageable file size for educational videos.
