  The use of mobile data offers another effective method to change an IP address on Android devices. Unlike Wi-Fi networks, which may assign the same IP address to a device over multiple connections, mobile data typically assigns a new IP address each time a device connects to the cellular network.
</p>
<p>
  This behavior stems from the nature of mobile networks, where devices connect to different cell towers as they move around. Each cell tower may have a unique IP address range, resulting in a change of IP address for the connected device.
</p>
<p>
  Changing IP addresses using mobile data can be particularly useful in situations where frequent IP address changes are desired, such as for enhancing privacy or bypassing certain network restrictions.
