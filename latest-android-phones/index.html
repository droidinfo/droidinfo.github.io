  AMOLED displays are a type of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display that uses a thin layer of organic material to produce light. This makes them more efficient and thinner than traditional LCD displays. AMOLED displays also have a wider color gamut and higher contrast ratio than LCD displays, which results in more vibrant colors and deeper blacks.
</p>
<p>
  The latest Android phones use AMOLED displays to provide users with an immersive viewing experience. This is especially important for watching movies, playing games, and browsing the web. AMOLED displays also make text easier to read, even in bright sunlight.

  Here is a table that compares the key features of AMOLED displays and LCD displays:
