    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Picture-in-picture Mode, Android Apps" title="Picture-in-picture Mode, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Picture-in-picture%20mode%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Picture-in-picture mode is a new feature in Android Oreo that allows users to watch videos in a small window while they use other apps. This is a great way to multitask, as users can watch a video while they check their email, browse the web, or use any other app.
</p>
<p>
  Picture-in-picture mode is especially useful for watching videos that are not full-screen, such as news clips or sports highlights. It is also useful for watching videos while you are doing other things, such as cooking or working out.
</p>
<p>
  To use picture-in-picture mode, simply start playing a video in a supported app. Then, tap the picture-in-picture icon in the video player. The video will then shrink to a small window that you can move around the screen. You can continue to use other apps while the video plays in the picture-in-picture window.
</p>
<p>
  Picture-in-picture mode is a great way to multitask and watch videos on your Android Oreo device. It is a convenient and easy-to-use feature that is sure to be appreciated by users.
</p>
<h3>Autofill</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Autofill, Android Apps" title="Autofill, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Autofill%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Autofill is a feature of Android Oreo that makes it easier to fill out forms by automatically filling in information from your Google account. This can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you have to fill out a lot of forms on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
  Autofill works with a variety of different apps and websites. It can fill in your name, address, email address, phone number, and other personal information. It can also fill in your credit card information and shipping address.
</p>
<p>
  To use Autofill, you first need to enable it in your Google account settings. Once you have enabled Autofill, it will automatically fill in your information whenever you fill out a form in a supported app or website.
</p>
<p>
  Autofill is a convenient and secure way to fill out forms. It can save you a lot of time and hassle, and it can help to protect your personal information from being stolen.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the benefits of using Autofill:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It saves you time.
  </li>
  <li>It reduces the risk of errors.
  </li>
  <li>It helps to protect your personal information.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you're not already using Autofill, I encourage you to give it a try. It's a great way to make your life easier and more secure.

<h3>Snoozing notifications</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Snoozing Notifications, Android Apps" title="Snoozing Notifications, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Snoozing%20notifications%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The introduction of snoozing notifications in Android Oreo has revolutionized the way users manage their notifications, providing them with greater control over their devices and enhancing their overall user experience.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved focus and productivity:</strong> With snoozing notifications, users can temporarily silence notifications from specific apps or all apps for a set period of time, allowing them to focus on tasks without distractions. This is particularly beneficial in situations such as meetings, study sessions, or when attempting to wind down before bed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Customized notification management:</strong> The ability to snooze notifications empowers users to tailor their notification settings to their individual preferences. They can choose to snooze notifications for a short period (e.g., 15 minutes) for quick interruptions or for a longer duration (e.g., 1 hour) for more extended periods of uninterrupted time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced notification fatigue:</strong> The constant stream of notifications can lead to notification fatigue, where users become overwhelmed and desensitized to important notifications. Snoozing notifications allows users to prioritize notifications and only receive those that are truly relevant at the moment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhanced digital well-being:</strong> By providing users with greater control over their notifications, Android Oreo promotes digital well-being by encouraging users to establish healthier habits around their smartphone usage. Snoozing notifications can help users disconnect from their devices and engage in more meaningful activities.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In conclusion, the snoozing notifications feature in Android Oreo empowers users with unprecedented control over their notifications, enabling them to customize their notification experience, improve their focus and productivity, and enhance their digital well-being. This feature underscores Android Oreo's commitment to providing users with a personalized and user-centric mobile experience.

    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Background Limits, Android Apps" title="Background Limits, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Background%20limits%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  In the era of smartphones, battery life and data consumption have become paramount concerns for users. Android Oreo addresses these concerns with the introduction of background limits, a feature that restricts apps from using excessive battery power or data in the background.
</p>
<p>
  Background limits play a crucial role in enhancing the overall user experience. By preventing apps from running unnecessary tasks in the background, Android Oreo significantly improves battery life. This is especially beneficial for devices with limited battery capacity or for users who heavily rely on their smartphones throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, background limits help users manage their data consumption more effectively. By restricting apps from using data in the background, users can avoid exceeding their data limits and incurring additional charges. This is particularly important for users with limited data plans or for those who frequently use their smartphones in areas with poor network connectivity.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation of background limits in Android Oreo has several practical applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Extended battery life:</strong> By limiting background activity, users can extend the battery life of their devices, allowing them to use their smartphones for longer periods without needing to recharge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced data consumption:</strong> Background limits help users stay within their data limits, preventing unexpected charges and ensuring they have sufficient data for essential tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved performance:</strong> By restricting background tasks, Android Oreo frees up system resources, resulting in improved overall performance and responsiveness of the device.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In conclusion, background limits in Android Oreo play a vital role in enhancing the user experience by optimizing battery life, managing data consumption, and improving device performance. This feature underscores Android Oreo's commitment to providing users with a more efficient and user-friendly mobile operating system.
