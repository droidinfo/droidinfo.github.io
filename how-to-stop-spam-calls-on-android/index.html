  <em>Call screening</em> is a feature that can be enabled on Android devices to help reduce the number of spam calls. When call screening is enabled, your device will automatically screen incoming calls and identify potential spam callers. You can then choose to answer the call, send it to voicemail, or block the number.
</p>
<p>
  Call screening is an effective way to reduce the number of spam calls you receive, and it is easy to enable. To enable call screening on your Android device, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Phone app.
  </li>
  <li>Tap the three dots in the top right corner of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>Tap Settings.
  </li>
  <li>Tap Call Screening.
  </li>
  <li>Toggle the switch to the On position.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once call screening is enabled, your device will automatically screen incoming calls. You will see a notification on your screen that says "Potential spam call" or "Scam likely." You can then choose to answer the call, send it to voicemail, or block the number.
</p>
<p>
  Call screening is a valuable tool that can help you reduce the number of spam calls you receive. It is easy to enable and use, and it can be a major time-saver.

<p>
  The National Do Not Call Registry is a government-run database of phone numbers that telemarketers are prohibited from calling. Registering your phone number with the Do Not Call Registry is a free and effective way to reduce the number of spam calls you receive.
</p>
<p>
  To register your phone number with the Do Not Call Registry, you can visit the Do Not Call Registry website or call 1-888-382-1222. You will need to provide your phone number, name, and address. Once you are registered, telemarketers will have 31 days to remove your number from their call lists.
</p>
<p>
  Registering with the Do Not Call Registry is not a foolproof way to stop spam calls, but it can significantly reduce the number of calls you receive. It is also important to note that the Do Not Call Registry only applies to telemarketers. Political organizations, charities, and debt collectors are not required to follow the Do Not Call Registry rules.

  Reporting spam calls to your carrier is an important part of stopping spam calls on Android. When you report a spam call to your carrier, they can add the number to their blacklist, which will prevent the number from calling you again.

</p>
<p>
  There are a few different ways to report spam calls to your carrier. You can call customer service, use the carrier's website, or use a third-party app. If you call customer service, be sure to have the phone number of the spam caller ready. If you use the carrier's website, you may be able to submit a report online. If you use a third-party app, the app will typically provide instructions on how to report spam calls.
</p>

<h3>Be careful about what information you share online</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Be Careful About What Information You Share Online, Android Apps" title="Be Careful About What Information You Share Online, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Be%20careful%20about%20what%20information%20you%20share%20online%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />

<p>
  Personal information, such as your name, address, and phone number, can be used by spammers to target you with unwanted calls. Be careful about what information you share online, especially on social media. Only share information with people you know and trust. Be wary of clicking on links in emails or text messages from unknown senders. These links could lead to phishing websites that are designed to steal your personal information.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 1: Social Media</strong><br />
    <p>
      When you share personal information on social media, it is important to be aware of who can see that information. Your posts may be visible to everyone, even if you only intended to share them with your friends. Be careful about sharing your phone number, address, or other personal information on social media.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Public Wi-Fi</strong><br />
    <p>
      Public Wi-Fi networks are not always secure. When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your personal information may be vulnerable to hackers. Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as your bank account or credit card information, when you are connected to a public Wi-Fi network.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Phishing Scams</strong><br />
    <p>
      Phishing scams are designed to trick you into giving up your personal information. Phishing emails or text messages may look like they are from a legitimate source, such as your bank or a government agency. However, these messages are actually designed to steal your personal information. Be careful about clicking on links in emails or text messages from unknown senders. If you are unsure whether an email or text message is legitimate, do not click on any links. Instead, contact the sender directly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Data Breaches</strong><br />
    <p>
      Data breaches are becoming increasingly common. When a data breach occurs, the personal information of millions of people may be compromised. If your personal information has been compromised in a data breach, be sure to change your passwords and monitor your credit reports for any unauthorized activity.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By being careful about what information you share online, you can reduce your risk of receiving spam calls. Spammers rely on personal information to target their victims. By protecting your personal information, you can make it more difficult for spammers to reach you.
</p>
<h3>Don&#039;t answer calls from unknown numbers</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Don&#039;t Answer Calls From Unknown Numbers, Android Apps" title="Don&#039;t Answer Calls From Unknown Numbers, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Don%27t%20answer%20calls%20from%20unknown%20numbers%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  In the realm of combating spam calls on Android devices, adopting the practice of refraining from answering calls originating from unfamiliar numbers holds significant relevance. This prudent measure contributes to an effective defense against the nuisance of spam calls while safeguarding personal data and privacy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 1: Identifying Potential Threats</strong><br />
    Screening unknown numbers acts as a crucial first step in identifying potential spam calls. Spammers frequently employ tactics such as spoofing legitimate phone numbers to deceive recipients. By declining to answer calls from unrecognized sources, individuals can minimize their exposure to fraudulent or malicious intent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Reducing Interruptions</strong><br />
    Spam calls can be highly disruptive, interrupting daily routines and causing inconvenience. By choosing not to engage with unknown callers, individuals can effectively reduce the number of interruptions they experience, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Protecting Personal Information</strong><br />
    Spam callers often attempt to obtain personal information, such as names, addresses, or financial details, through conversation. By refusing to answer calls from unknown numbers, individuals can safeguard their sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Avoiding Scams</strong><br />
    Spam calls are frequently used as a means to perpetrate scams, such as phishing attempts or fraudulent offers. By declining to answer calls from unknown numbers, individuals can minimize their risk of falling victim to these deceptive practices.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In summary, adhering to the practice of not answering calls from unknown numbers serves as a valuable strategy in the fight against spam calls on Android devices. This measure empowers individuals to protect their privacy, minimize interruptions, safeguard personal information, and avoid potential scams.
