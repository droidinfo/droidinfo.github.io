  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Range:</strong> Dynamic range measures the camera's ability to capture both bright and dark areas of a scene without losing detail in either. A wider dynamic range results in more balanced and realistic images.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Color Accuracy: <strong>Color accuracy refers to how faithfully the camera reproduces colors in an image. Accurate color reproduction ensures that images appear natural and lifelike.</strong></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sharpness:</strong> Sharpness refers to the level of detail and clarity in an image. Sharper images have well-defined edges and fine details are clearly visible.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The combination of these factors contributes to the overall image quality of a smartphone camera. When evaluating "best android camera phone 2023" options, it is essential to consider image quality as a key criterion.
