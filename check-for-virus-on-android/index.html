    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Permission Management</strong><br />
    <p>
      Regularly review the permissions granted to installed apps. Revoke permissions that are no longer necessary or if you suspect an app may be misusing them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Permission-Based Threat Mitigation</strong><br />
    <p>
      By carefully managing app permissions, you can reduce the risk of malicious apps gaining access to sensitive data or causing harm to your device. For example, denying camera permissions to a suspicious app can prevent it from taking unauthorized photos or videos.
