</p>
<p>
  Before you make a move, take a look at the board and plan your next few moves. This will help you make the most of your moves and avoid getting stuck.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Don't be afraid to restart a level.</strong>

<p>
  If you are stuck on a level, don't be afraid to restart it. This will give you a fresh start and a chance to try a different strategy.
