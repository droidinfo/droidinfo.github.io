  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Debugging your code</strong><br />
    The debugger allows you to step through your code and debug any issues. This is useful for identifying and fixing bugs in your code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integration with Android Studio</strong><br />
    The emulator and debugger are tightly integrated with Android Studio. This makes it easy to debug your apps and ensure that they are working properly.

<h3>Support for multiple programming languages (Java, Kotlin)</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Support For Multiple Programming Languages (Java, Kotlin), Android Apps" title="Support For Multiple Programming Languages (Java, Kotlin), Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Support%20for%20multiple%20programming%20languages%20%28Java%2C%20Kotlin%29%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Android Studio supports multiple programming languages, including Java and Kotlin. This is a significant advantage, as it allows developers to choose the language that they are most comfortable with or that is best suited for their project.
</p>
<p>
  Java is a popular programming language that has been used for Android development for many years. It is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for developing complex Android apps. However, Kotlin is a newer language that has been gaining popularity in recent years. Kotlin is a more concise and expressive language than Java, and it can help developers to write code that is more readable and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
  Android Studio's support for multiple programming languages gives developers the flexibility to choose the language that is best suited for their project. This can help developers to be more productive and to create better Android apps.
