<p>
  When choosing a video call app for Android and iOS, it is important to consider how easy the app is to use. After all, you don't want to spend more time figuring out how to use the app than you do actually making video calls.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Intuitive interface:</strong> The best video call apps have an intuitive interface that makes it easy to find the features you need. You shouldn't have to fumble around trying to figure out how to make a call or change your settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear instructions:</strong> If you do need help using the app, there should be clear instructions available. This could be in the form of a help menu, FAQs, or even video tutorials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minimal training required:</strong> Ideally, you should be able to start using the video call app without any training. However, if some training is required, it should be minimal and easy to follow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Positive user reviews:</strong> One of the best ways to gauge the ease of use of a video call app is to read user reviews. If the app has a lot of positive reviews, it is likely that it is easy to use.

    <strong>Privacy policy:</strong> It is also important to read the privacy policy of any video call app that you are considering using. The privacy policy should explain how the app collects, uses, and shares your data. Make sure that you are comfortable with the app's privacy policy before you start using it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security track record:</strong> Finally, it is also important to consider the security track record of any video call app that you are considering using. Has the app ever been hacked? Have there been any security breaches? If so, how did the app respond to these incidents?
