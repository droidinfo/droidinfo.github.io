<p>
  While Paramount+ with Android TV offers a compelling streaming experience, it is not without its drawbacks. Understanding these limitations can help users make informed decisions about whether the service meets their specific needs and expectations.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Lack of Free Trial:</strong><br />
    Unlike many other streaming services, Paramount+ does not offer a free trial period. This means that users must commit to a paid subscription without the opportunity to test the service beforehand. While this may not be a major drawback for users who are confident in their decision, it can be a deterrent for those who prefer to try before they buy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited Live TV Selection:</strong><br />
    Paramount+'s live TV offering, while convenient, is somewhat limited compared to other streaming services. Users may find that their preferred live TV channels are not available on the platform. This can be a significant drawback for users who rely on streaming services as their primary source of live TV.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These drawbacks should be carefully considered when evaluating Paramount+ with Android TV. While the service offers a wide range of content and features, the lack of a free trial and the limited live TV selection may be deal-breakers for some users. Potential subscribers are advised to weigh these factors against the benefits of the service to determine if it is the right choice for their streaming needs.
