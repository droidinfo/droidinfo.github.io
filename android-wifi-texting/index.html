  <li>
    <strong>Multimedia sharing:</strong> When sharing multimedia content, such as photos or videos, a stable connection is essential to prevent disruptions during the transfer process, ensuring that files are received in their entirety.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In remote areas or places with poor cellular coverage, Wi-Fi texting provides a reliable alternative to ensure uninterrupted communication. It allows users to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues, even in challenging network conditions.
