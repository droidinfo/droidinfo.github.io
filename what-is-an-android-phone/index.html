</p>
<p>
  The affordability of Android phones is due to several factors. First, Android is an open-source operating system, which means that manufacturers do not have to pay licensing fees to use it. This reduces the cost of producing Android phones.
</p>
<p>
  Second, there is a wide range of Android phone manufacturers, which creates competition and drives down prices. Additionally, many Android phone manufacturers are based in China, where labor costs are lower.

  The affordability of Android phones has been a major factor in their success. It has allowed Android phones to become the most popular mobile operating system in the world.
</p>
<p>
  The affordability of Android phones has several practical implications. First, it means that more people can afford to own a smartphone. This can have a significant impact on people's lives, as smartphones can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as staying connected with friends and family, accessing information and education, and managing finances.
</p>
<p>
  Second, the affordability of Android phones has helped to drive down the cost of smartphones overall. This has made smartphones more accessible to people in developing countries, where incomes are typically lower.
