<p>
  The format of your ad is one of the most important factors to consider when creating ads on Android. The three main ad formats are text, display, and video.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Text ads</strong> are the simplest and most affordable type of ad. They consist of a headline, a body, and a call to action. Text ads are typically used to promote websites, apps, or products.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Display ads</strong> are more visually appealing than text ads. They can include images, videos, or interactive elements. Display ads are typically used to promote brands or products.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Video ads</strong> are the most engaging type of ad. They can be used to tell a story, demonstrate a product, or create a call to action. Video ads are typically used to promote brands, products, or services.
</p>
<p>
  The format of your ad will depend on your budget, your target audience, and your marketing goals. If you have a small budget, text ads are a good option. If you want to reach a large audience, display ads are a good choice. And if you want to create a memorable and engaging ad, video ads are the way to go.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a table summarizing the key differences between text, display, and video ads:

<h3>Size</h3>

    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Size, Android Apps" title="Size, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Size%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The size of your ad is an important factor to consider when creating ads on Android. The size of your ad will depend on the format of your ad. Text ads have a maximum size of 90 characters, while display and video ads can vary in size.
</p>
<p>
  The size of your ad will affect its visibility and impact. Larger ads are more visible and can have a greater impact on users. However, larger ads can also be more expensive.
</p>
<p>
  When choosing the size of your ad, you need to consider your budget and your target audience. If you have a small budget, you may want to choose a smaller ad size. If you want to reach a large audience, you may want to choose a larger ad size.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a table summarizing the key information about ad sizes on Android:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">

<p>
  By understanding the different ad sizes and how they can be used to achieve your marketing goals, you can create effective ads that will reach your target audience and help you achieve your business objectives.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some additional tips for choosing the right ad size:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider the placement of your ad. Some ad placements have specific size requirements.
  </li>
  <li>Test different ad sizes to see what works best for your campaign.
  </li>
  <li>Use high-quality images and videos in your ads. This will help your ads stand out from the competition.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Cost, Android Apps" title="Cost, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Cost%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  The cost of ads on Android can vary depending on the pricing model used. The three main pricing models are pay-per-click (PPC), pay-per-impression (PPI), and pay-per-view (PPV).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Pay-per-click (PPC)</strong><br />
    With PPC, you only pay when someone clicks on your ad. This is a good option if you want to drive traffic to your website or app.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pay-per-impression (PPI)</strong><br />
    With PPI, you pay each time your ad is displayed. This is a good option if you want to increase brand awareness or reach a large audience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pay-per-view (PPV)</strong><br />
    With PPV, you only pay when someone watches your video ad. This is a good option if you want to promote a video or generate leads.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The cost of your ad campaign will depend on a number of factors, including your budget, your target audience, and the pricing model you choose. It is important to carefully consider your options and choose a pricing model that fits your marketing goals and budget.
</p>
<h3>Targeting</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" alt="Targeting, Android Apps" title="Targeting, Android Apps" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Targeting%2C%20android%20apps&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
    </center>
<p>
  Targeting is a critical component of any successful ad campaign. It allows you to reach your desired audience with the right message, at the right time. When it comes to ads on Android, targeting is especially important, as there are over 2.5 billion active Android devices worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of different ways to target your ads on Android. You can target based on demographics, such as age, gender, and location. You can also target based on interests, such as hobbies, activities, and purchase history. And you can target based on behaviors, such as app usage, website visits, and in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
  The more specific you are with your targeting, the more effective your ads will be. For example, if you are selling a fitness app, you might want to target people who are interested in health and fitness. Or, if you are selling a new game, you might want to target people who have downloaded other games in the past.
</p>

Once you have this information, you can calculate your CLTV by multiplying your customer's worth by their lifetime.

  <li>
    <strong>Brand awareness:</strong> Brand awareness is a measure of how well your brand is known among your target audience. To measure brand awareness, you can track metrics such as website traffic, social media engagement, and search volume.
