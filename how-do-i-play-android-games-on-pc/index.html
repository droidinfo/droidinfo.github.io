    <strong>Platform Exclusives:</strong> Some cloud gaming platforms may have exclusive deals with certain game developers, resulting in a limited selection of games that are only available on their platform. This can be a disadvantage for users who are looking for a wider variety of games to play.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> Cloud gaming platforms may have technical limitations that restrict the types of games that can be streamed. For example, games that require high-end graphics or complex inputs may not be suitable for cloud gaming due to latency and performance issues.

    <strong>Regional Availability:</strong> The availability of games on cloud gaming platforms can vary depending on geographical location. Some games may not be available in certain regions due to licensing restrictions or other factors, further limiting the game selection for users in those regions.

</ul>
<p>
  Understanding the limited game selection on cloud gaming platforms is essential for making informed decisions about "how do I play Android games on PC." Depending on the specific games you want to play and your preferences, emulators may offer a wider selection and greater flexibility in terms of game availability.
