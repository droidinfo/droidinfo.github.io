</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Android SDK integration</strong>: The IDE should integrate with the Android SDK, providing developers with access to all of the Android APIs and tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Layout editor</strong>: The IDE should include a layout editor that allows developers to create and edit Android layouts visually.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resource editor</strong>: The IDE should include a resource editor that allows developers to create and edit Android resources, such as images, strings, and colors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Emulator and debugger</strong>: The IDE should include an emulator and debugger that allows developers to test and debug their Android applications on a virtual device.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few of the many Android-specific features that are available in an IDE for Android. By using these features, developers can significantly improve their productivity and efficiency when developing Android applications.
