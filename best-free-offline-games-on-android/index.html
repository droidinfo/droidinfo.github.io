  When it comes to choosing the best free offline games on Android, the size of the game is an important consideration. Some games can be quite large, so you need to make sure that you have enough storage space on your device before you download them. If you don't have enough storage space, you may need to delete some other apps or files to make room for the game.

  As you can see, the file sizes of free offline games on Android can vary significantly. If you have a limited amount of storage space on your device, you may want to stick with smaller games. However, if you have a lot of storage space, you can enjoy some of the larger games that are available.

<p>
  It's also important to keep in mind that some games may require additional storage space for updates and additional content. So, it's always a good idea to have a little bit of extra storage space available.
