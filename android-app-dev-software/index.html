</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Unit testing</b> focuses on testing individual units of code, such as methods or classes, in isolation. It helps to identify and fix errors in the early stages of development, preventing them from propagating to larger components of the application.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Integration testing</b> tests the interactions between different components of an application, such as how activities, services, and content providers work together. It helps to ensure that these components communicate and collaborate correctly, reducing the risk of unexpected errors or crashes.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>UI testing</b> tests the user interface of an application, ensuring that it is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. It helps to identify issues such as broken layouts, incorrect functionality, or accessibility problems, enhancing the overall user experience.
</p>
<p>
  These three types of testing are interconnected and complementary. Unit testing provides a solid foundation by ensuring the reliability of individual code components. Integration testing builds upon this foundation by verifying the interactions between components, and UI testing completes the cycle by validating the user-facing aspects of the application.
</p>
<p>
  By embracing a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing, Android developers can significantly improve the quality and reliability of their applications.
